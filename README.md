Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Please use the following command to install all relevant packages:

### `npm install --force`

The force flag is needed as I am using some specific versions of packages that might be conflicting with each other.
